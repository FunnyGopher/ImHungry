# ImHungry
Iâ€™m Hungry is an Android application that helps a user, or group of users, decide where to eat. Users can save their favorite places to eat in the application. From those places, one can be randomly chosen based on things such as how far away the place is, or how expensive the food is. Custom tags can be attached to the places for custom filtering. For deciding where to eat when in a group, users can submit places to a voting pot. Once all members of the group have submitted their choices, members will vote on their desired place out of choices from the pot. Users can also share places with others via NFC or QR Code.
